# Synology

This repository contains a set of Python scripts that streamline processes not supported by Synology services (e.g. Synology Photos). Each script is responsible for its own goal and is documented in a README file located in the script directory.

## Avaliable scripts

The full list of the scripts can be found below.

### Photo Dumper

This Python script allows you to import photos to your Synology NAS form a local disk, an external drive, a removable storage (such as a USB stick and SD cards) or even from the NAS itself. The script organises photos in folders in the target directory in the same way Synology Photos does, based on the dates the photos were taken.
